## Technologies and tools

*  Commit Message Linter - hook it will run at every commiting to make sure that the message to commit is valid against the conventions
*  Jest -  Javascript Tester Tool
* TypeScript - Static Typing
* Eslint  - Find and Fix problems in the code
* Husky - Help creating hooks in pre or pos commits. For instance, format the code using eslint before commit something.

## Install Dependencies
``npm install``

## Run Tests
``npm test``

## Routes
1) Exercise  
``/print-numbers?range=100``
PS.: Whether query params isn't defined, the default value (100) will be defined.


2) Exercise
``/countries/list``
``/countries/official-languages?language=de``
``/countries/highest-languages``
``/countries/common-languages``

PS.: I know that one controller should have just five methods: get, put, post, patch and delete. I've create the countries functions inside of same controller just to abreviate it.
